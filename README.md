<p>Wolf reached out to PlebLab to make something cool for the Bitcoin builder space. We were stoked they gave us the opportunity to create whatever we wanted. PlebLab wanted to do something different than a typical 3-day hackathon. We wanted to take the competition to another level. By participating in Top Builder, you can win 15K in Bitcoin. This is equity-free and is not something Wolf or PlebLab is investing in your project. The real reward is in what you've built. The money buys you time to work on it and is designed to level you up as a builder in Bitcoin. We are trying to bring what makes PlebLab a special place but online and remote for the first time.</p>
